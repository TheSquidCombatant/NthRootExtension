# NthRootExtension
C# implementation of an extension method to quickly calculate an Nth root for BigInteger value. By Nikolai TheSquid.

## How to use
Basicly you can copy class [NthRootExtension](System.Numerics.Extensions/NthRootExtension.cs) to your project and add using for namespace System.Numerics.Extensions.

## How to test
You can start random and specified Nth root tests right after clone repository and build solution. You must run generate tests and rebuild solution before start speed Nth root tests.

## How to extend
I will be glad to merge your pull requests for improve Nth root calculation performance. Even if the improvement affects only individual cases from the range of values.
